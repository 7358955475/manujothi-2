    <h1>Tamil Literature Classics</h1>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Tamil Literature</h2>
        <p>Tamil literature has a rich and ancient history spanning over two millennia. The earliest works in Tamil date back to the 3rd century BCE, making it one of the oldest living literary traditions in the world.</p>

        <p>The classical period of Tamil literature, known as the Sangam age, produced some of the finest poetry and prose in the language. These works dealt with themes of love, war, nature, and human emotions with remarkable depth and sophistication.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "யாதும் ஊரே யாவரும் கேளிர்" - "Every place is our home and all people are our kin" - This famous line from Kuruntokai exemplifies the universal outlook of Tamil literature.
        </div>

        <p>The literary works from this period can be broadly classified into two categories: Akam (interior/love poetry) and Puram (exterior/heroic poetry). Akam poetry deals with the emotional and psychological aspects of love, while Puram poetry focuses on war, valor, and social themes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter page-break">
        <h2>Chapter 2: Major Works and Authors</h2>
        <p>Among the greatest works of Tamil literature are the Tirukkural by Thiruvalluvar, which consists of 1330 couplets covering ethics, politics, and love. This work is considered a masterpiece of moral philosophy and practical wisdom.</p>

        <p>The epic Silappatikaram by Ilango Adigal tells the story of Kannagi and is notable for its literary excellence and cultural significance. It beautifully weaves together elements of music, dance, and poetry.</p>

        <p>Bharathiyar, the great modern Tamil poet, revolutionized Tamil poetry in the early 20th century with his patriotic fervor and social reform ideals. His works continue to inspire readers today.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "அச்சமில்லை அச்சமில்லை அச்சமென்பதில்லையே" - "Fear not, fear not, there is no such thing as fear" - Bharathiyar's famous line that embodies courage and determination.
        </div>

    <div class="chapter page-break">
        <h2>Chapter 3: Themes and Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Tamil literature has always been deeply philosophical, exploring themes of dharma, karma, and the meaning of life. The concept of 'aram' (righteousness) is central to many works, emphasizing moral and ethical living.</p>

        <p>Nature plays a significant role in Tamil poetry, with detailed descriptions of landscapes, seasons, and natural phenomena. The five-fold classification of land (tinai) in Sangam literature shows the deep connection between human emotions and natural environments.</p>

        <p>Love, both human and divine, is another dominant theme. The tradition of bhakti poetry, exemplified by the works of Nayanars and Alvars, expresses intense devotion through beautiful verses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter page-break">
        <h2>Chapter 4: Modern Tamil Literature</h2>
        <p>The 20th and 21st centuries have seen Tamil literature evolve and adapt to modern themes while maintaining its classical roots. Writers like Kalki Krishnamurthy, Jayakanthan, and Ashokamitran have contributed significantly to contemporary Tamil prose.</p>

        <p>Modern Tamil literature addresses social issues, urban life, women's rights, and global themes while preserving the essence of Tamil culture and values. The medium has expanded to include novels, short stories, and experimental forms of writing.</p>

        <p>Today, Tamil literature continues to thrive with new voices emerging regularly, ensuring that this ancient tradition remains vibrant and relevant for future generations.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "The beauty of Tamil literature lies not just in its antiquity, but in its ability to speak to the human condition across all ages and cultures."
